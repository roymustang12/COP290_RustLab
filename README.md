--For RHEL-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.):

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libpango1.0-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev libxcursor-dev

This installs the equivalent dependencies for the FLTK crate on Debian-based systems. These packages provide the necessary development files for X11, Pango, Xinerama, XFT, and XCursor that FLTK requires to build properly.
